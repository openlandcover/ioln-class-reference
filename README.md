# IOLN Class Reference

This work for the class reference for the Open Landcover Mapping for India is adapted from the [Brazilian Mapbiomas Interpretation Keys](https://chave.lapig.iesa.ufg.br/en/)

The aim is twofold:

1. Come up for a definition for the different classes that are relevant for the Indian context and this for across the biogeographic regions.

2. How to identify these classes using True Color Composities (TCC), False Color Composites (FCC), reference maps or other (Interpretation Keys).

3. Identify if there are a regional differences in definition (if any) of the classes and/or interpretation keys.
