## Description

 Evergreen forests are landcover types characterized by dense tree canopy cover where the majority of trees retain their leaves throughout the year. In landcover classification, evergreen forests are identified by persistent green foliage, minimal seasonal leaf loss, and a closed canopy structure. They are distinguished from deciduous forests by their year-round photosynthetic activity and stable canopy appearance.
